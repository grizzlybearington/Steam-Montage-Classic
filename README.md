Tool to create a grid of your steam games, like [this](https://i.imgur.com/JaIS7a6.jpg) or even [this](https://i.imgur.com/YPfQaEK.png).

## Instructions
Run, insert steamid or 64-bit id, insert the amount of width in tiles, and click the Montage button.  
**NOTE:** This ~~can~~ **will** generate large, lossless files, depending on the size of your library!

#### //TODO:
*Implement ban list to prevent some games from showing up (DLC, etc.)  
*Option for micro logos, like [this](http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steamcommunity/public/images/apps/570/d4f836839254be08d8e9dd333ecc9a01782c26d2.jpg).  
*Allow sorting by play time (maybe)
